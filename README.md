# japanese-langauge-search-chrome-extension

Extension I built based off of all the scripts I had running on my computer.

The goal is to be able to get information about Japanese words quickly for making Anki flash cards.

just type `jp` then press tab and your search query in the search bar.

On Jisho there should be a download button but chrome is crashing when I try to use that right now 
so the code is being executed with tamper monkey at the moment. 

Once the download issues is fixed this plugin will be pushed to the play store so others can enjoy.
